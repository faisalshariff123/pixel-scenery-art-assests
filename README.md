# Pixel Scenery Art Assets

A personal collection of pixel based environment artwork created by **Faisal Shariff**.  
These scenes are used across multiple web and game-style projects to build immersive backgrounds and visual consistency.

## Purpose

This repo showcases my growth in visual environment design such as focusing on lighting, mood, composition, shading, and atmosphere. Every piece is hand drawn and crafted to be reused in my personal projects (such as web apps, game prototypes, and UI backgrounds).

---

## Technical Info

- Dimensions vary depending on usage (desktop/full-screen vs mobile); main focus is on square crops.  
- Created using [piskelapp.com](piskelapp.com) and Pixelorama and exported as PNG.  
- Files kept simple and organized: more scene categories will be added over time.
