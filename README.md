# ðŸŽ¨ Pixel Scenery Art Assets

A personal collection of pixel-based environment artwork created by **Faisal Shariff**.  
These scenes are used across multiple web and game-style projects to build immersive 2D backgrounds and visual consistency.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

This repo showcases my growth in visual environment design â€” focusing on lighting, mood, composition, and atmosphere. Every piece is hand-drawn and crafted to be reused in my personal projects (such as web apps, game prototypes, and UI backgrounds).

## ðŸ§° Technical Info

- Dimensions vary depending on usage (desktop/full-screen vs mobile); main focus is on 16 : 9 aspect ratio or square crops.  
- Created using Aseprite (or other pixel-art tools) + exported as PNG.  
- Files kept simple and organized: more scene categories will be added over time.
